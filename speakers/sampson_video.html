        <h3>February
          <br>Scott Sampson
        </h3>
        <p>
          What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage Utahceratops! Come to the
          Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the
          Utah Museum of Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has focused on the
          ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has conducted fieldwork in a number
          of countries in Africa.
<br><br>
          Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from the
          University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species of ceratopsids, or horned
          dinosaurs, from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the growth and function of certopsid
          horns and frills.
<br><br>
          Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the American Museum of Natural
          History in New York City, followed by five years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New
          York College of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University of Utah
          accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the Department of Geology and Geophysics
          and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural History. His research
          interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics, functional morphology, and evolution of
          Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.
<br><br>
          In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has conducted paleontological
          work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was
          also the on-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently completed a book,
          Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life, which is one of the most
          comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their worlds to date.
